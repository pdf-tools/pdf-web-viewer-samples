# PDF Web Viewer View Options

This example showcases how to override the default view options set by a PDF document, such as initialFitMode, initialPageLayoutMode, initialPageNumber, and initialZoom. By providing these options, the PDF Web Viewer can be used to display the PDF document according to specific view preferences, disregarding the default view options provided by the PDF document itself.
