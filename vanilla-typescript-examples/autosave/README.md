# Autosave

This example showcases how to enable automatic saving of changes made to a PDF document within PDF Web Viewer. The autosave feature eliminates the need for the user to manually save changes, and an external endpoint is used for saving. It provides a convenient and time-saving option for the user, as well as reducing the risk of data loss in case of any unexpected disruptions.
